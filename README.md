#  Maple-LibInjector

An executable listener designed for code-injection. Eventually going to listen for multiple Bundle IDs to inject variable dylibs into.

## Usage

*Current usage*: `./Maple-LibInjector <bundle-id> <injectable.dylib>`
Desired usage: `./Maple-LibInjector <maple-listen-file>`

- This would allow the listener to inject into one process using one centralized listener, opposed to a multitude of the same process running on a target machine  

## Maple Listen File Format

`
<bundle-id> <dylib-path>
<bundle-id> <dylib-path>
...
...
`
